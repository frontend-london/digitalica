(1, 1, '1. What is your background in art? what you do now, where you live etc?', 'Always drawing as a kid, any kind of art was only a pastime until I turned                                   to Graphic Design in the early 90\'s and studied this for 6 years in both                                   Nottingham and Newcastle. It was almost by accident I turned my hand to                                   digital design, and ended up producing the UK\'s first interactive CD ROM of                                   all my fellow design graduate portfolios, which also appeared on the cover                                   mounted disc with Creative Review Magazine. <br /><br />                                     I entered the world of digital design employment in 1995 and by 1997                                   (which brought me to London, UK) was forming my own agency with Felix                                   Velarde. Underwired Amaze is our second agency and I am still the Creative                                   Director (with an Art Director role included) with responsibility for not                                   just design work, but also technical implementation (front end) and                                   usability.'),
(5, 3, '1. Hi Greg , thank you so much for participating in this interview. I have been following you for some time and really respect what you do. Can you begin by telling us a little about your background? Where are you from and how did you get your start as a creative designer?', 'Thank you Aneta, much appreciated. I\'m originally from Poland, however I left it seven years ago, traveled a little bit and this year moved to Edinburgh, Scotland to oversee design department at government organisation. <br />      I\'d say my creative journey started many years before I sat in the front of computer for a first time and drew the a line in LOGO. Twenty five years later you can find very similar system when drawing at canvas in HTML5, so if you haven\'t heard about the LOGO you are not loosing too much.'),
(6, 3, '2. Most of digitalica readers probably know you from your website: <a href="http://www.pencilrebel.com" target="_blank">www.pencilrebel.com</a> Tell us a little about your website. How did it come about? How did you initially envision this site and has its direction changed over time?', ' Well, yes, that was a long project and I did couple of one hours long speeches about it at FITC conferences and few other places however in this case with full respect I will make a long story short. Eight months, over 500 hours of work and massive amount of purest fun. Project with commercial value zero which turned out to win lot of awards and was one of the Top Performing games on Disney XD USA. <br />      It was done in flash, which is great. I know a lot of people are now raving about "flash being dead" and it\'s true, flash is dead for sliding banners or full flash websites but ironically it is far away from being dead as environment for descent iphone apps. I\'ve done it, it\'s great actually the hardest bit it getting certificate from apple. <br />      Javascript on the over hand is promising too but for time being it\'s good for platform and tower defense type games but making something more flashy will be quite challenging. Let me bring here the answer of Seb Lee-Delisle regarding my question about CPU usage: "if your heating\'s broke, this would be a good way to replace it."<br />'),
(7, 3, '3. What role has social media played in your website success?', 'In 2007/2008 social media did not play as massive role as it does today. Apart from that I spent L150 on this project so I would not have money for a huge social media campaign and sharing link via private channel with fb friends and twitter is useless, it won\'t make you famous or rich, you know it, don\'t you ? <br />      You just need to live with the fact that there will always be cute kittens video that will have more hits on youtube than your best paid project. <br />      Fact that Charlie Sheen has The Guinness World Record in "Fastest time to reach 1 million followers” (1m in 25hours) does it mean anyone will use his service in this area at all. <br />      Very popular video by Giovanny Gutierrez who filmed his girlfriend bottom in the front of Wii did not get him a job at Nintendo. Actually that was a tricky one as Giovanny probably didn\'t know the fact that 80% of Wii users in USA are women. From the brand point of view, if you are not exhibitionist you won\'t feel comfortable with playing Wii when your man is at home. Would I employ him? Absolutely not as he completely doesn\'t know my audience. <br />      Retweet my tweet to win an iPad sounds like a spam nowadays , doesn\'t it ? <br />      So, social media are cool, but campaign will work if it\'s a part of bigger, well thought process. '),
(8, 3, '4. Are you working on any exciting new projects that you would like to share with us?', 'Running my department is very exciting project every day. Working closely with development and three marketing departments is quite challenging. Stop motion animation is very close to my heart so I have few personal projects on the way, my first proper music video clip,  promo materials for well known business cards company and advert for well know internet browser. '),
(9, 3, '5. Handmade or digital? choose one , and why?', 'Handmade or digital ? That does not compute. Analog Input, Digital Output that works very well, always.'),
(10, 3, '6. What’s the best advice someone has given you?', 'Keep calm and carry on? but that\'s from a poster. I don\'t know really, I don\'t think anyone ever did. In design industry, people are thinking too much about what others may think about them. It creates lot of constrains and mental blocks. Just follow common sense and do what you really want to do. If you do not have common sense in design and you do not know what you really want to achieve in this area, you should probably start coding. That will save you a lot of pain and disappointment.  <br />      There is a plenty of great conferences in Europe, off the top of my head, FITC Amsterdam 2012 (<a href="http://www.fitc.ca/events/about/?event=125" target="_blank">http://www.fitc.ca/events/about/?event=125</a>), Beyond Tellerrand - Germany (<a href="http://play12.beyondtellerrand.com" target="_blank">http://play12.beyondtellerrand.com</a>) FOTB - UK (<a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/" target="_blank">http://www.flashonthebeach.com/</a>) - I had a word with John and it will come back this year 2012 with different name. OFFF - Spain (<a href="http://www.offf.ws/2012/" target="_blank">http://www.offf.ws/2012/</a>). It won\'t be cheap but get out yourself for one of these and it will change your life forever. '),
(11, 3, '7. So be creative... be unique... what does it mean for you?', 'That is a tricky question, I understand creative as a drive to create things which plays on emotions of targeted audience. To be unique means for me to do stuff which is different that current approved standard. The problem with this approach is you may be too creative for the type of clients your company works for or your style is too unique and you won\'t find a project, means, you earn no money. <br />      Advice if I may, if you feel something is not like it should with your career, change a job every 1-2 years. It will improve and expand your skills as well as give you free rise in a salary. In your spare time do what you love to do until it becomes your job.'),
(12, 3, 'Thanks again, for doing this interview ;)      Thank you and I hope all will work out well for everyone this year, all best. G.', ''),
(13, 2, 'First off ...hello .. how are you? I haven\'t heard from you for ages. Thanks so much for taking  the time to answer some questions for new Digitalica readers ;)', 'It\'s been a while, that\'s true. I\'m pretty well, thank you, just older, not much wiser though :) <br />                                          Life\'s been treating me pretty good, I can\'t really complain - although there were some pretty rough times, all in all it turned out fine.'),
(14, 2, 'Good designers learn and improve over time. What are some of the important lessons you\'ve learned along the way?', 'That I can do almost anything :) When you set your sights on a goal and you commit to that goal, there\'s nothing to stop you. I like to think about myself as a renaissance man because of the many, many things that interest me and the scope of knowledge I amassed over all those years - it might not be very thorough, mind you, but there just so little time in one day :) But when I got back to Warszawa for the second time in my life and started working at MRM Worldwide, I thought I wanted to only do my pixels, nothing else. Then I got challenged with other aspects of the agency work - client related, project management related, accounting even - I was sure to fail. But I didn\'t, I learned a lot and got a new perspective on my own work, started to move in a direction I never thought I wanted to go.'),
(15, 2, 'What\'s the best advice someone has given you?', 'If you grumble, you don\'t fuck :) I\'ve spent quite some time with people, who gave me a new and much more simpler perspective on life that I used to have and i\'m trying to stick to that "philosophy of simplicity" - to not overthink things. And to let things flow and follow that flow - not to stand against the current. Like a straw, bend with the wind to not break, but to stand up again when the wind stops. Something along those lines, at least :)'),
(16, 2, 'Design theory and trends are constantly shifting and evolving. What do you think we\'ll see more of in 2012?', 'I can\'t really say, since i\'m not really following trends too close. I\'ve been seeing more and more simple and "typograhic" portfolios and webpages - nice, big headers with nice, big, clean body texts. But it must be my bad eyesight and aging taking the better of me :) It took years for us to come from pixel fonts in sizes below readability, really, to arrive to headers at 40-60 points in custom typeface size. I\'ve always been an admirer of "less is more" doctrine and tried to follow that philosophy, now there are pretty neat tools to do that. I\'ve seen pretty awesome things that use iPhones in connection with desktop computers to achieve a very ambient effect - I\'d like to do more of that myself, to use many of the available tools and devices to connect them in one seamless project, to use Augmented Reality (although I HATE that term), there\'s still much to do on that field. <br />                                          What I would really like to see is more "freedom from facebook" - lately I feel like people (meaning mostly clients) took Facebook for granted and turned it into "new internet" and everyone is "doing something on fb" - it\'s a great tool, but it\'s just a tool, not a solution to all your problems, for crying out loud. We\'ve been laughing at the idea that in one or two years from now we\'re gonna go back to standalone pages on custom domain names and everyone will think it\'ll be such a fucking avantgarde thing to do, "you\'re not doing it on facebook? that\'s radical...". Pretty sad perspective.'),
(17, 2, 'Handmade or digital? choose one , and why?', 'Maybe I should say digital, but more and more I\'d like to touch the stuff I do. I read books on my phone out of convenience, but I really prefer the printed thing, the smell of the paint, touch of paper, especially the old one - the same with art, I love what people are doing with pixels, but I\'d like to hang that shit on my wall, you know? And I\'m not talking about printed out on a laser plotter or something - I want it done by hand, on a real canvas or wood, with real paint and brush, I want it dirty, not really finished, rough and not so close to the line. You can\'t undo, yes, but the feeling is real :) You can redo though, over and over again, aiming for that perfection. Too bad I really suck at that myself, since I can\'t do shit on my own - draw or paint - but they say there\'s always time to learn. And I learn to appreciate art in general, but especially in non-digital form, for example recently I fell in love with Audrey Kawasaki\'s work - it\'s absolutely gorgeous.'),
(18, 2, 'If you could collaborate with one other artist, designer? who would it be?', 'I do collaborate with great artists on a daily basis, although the projects we work on are strictly commercial :) I\'ve always wanted to work with Joshua Davis, but more as a apprentice, a fly-on-the-wall rather then a fellow designer, I want to know his secret, his tricks :) <br />                                          Currently I\'m working on an idea for a project that will support Infantile Spasms and Epilepsy Awareness foundation, I\'ve already took part in production of two books they\'re selling on blurb.com and raising money to spread the word and educate on this rare and difficult condition. And I\'ll try to invite some of the best people I\'ve met over the years to make it the most awesome shit there is - the cause is so right it has to work :)'),
(19, 2, 'What are some of your favorite design blogs that you read?', 'I don\'t really :) I stopped following design blogs years ago and pretty much thought link sites died off - I was wrong, obviously :) And thank to gods for that. When I was doing some packaging stuff I\'ve been reading thedieline.com and yankodesign.com all the time. Nowadays, I visit Behance on a daily basis - just to piss myself off, I guess, at the quality of work OTHER people do. The old classics, like surfstation, designiskinky... I don\'t, really - mostly because I just don\'t have the time.'),
(20, 2, 'So, what\'s next...?', 'More work :) There are ideas coming in, there\'s lot to do still, another day, another challenge... There\'s this project for Infantile Spasm foundation, I\'ve been talking with Jedrek Kostecki about some things we want to do together, I have a couple of photo projects on my mind, an idea for a desktop/iphone application... And since restless and unstoppable Wojtek Krosnowski is my CD, there\'s no telling when we\'re gonna stop - there\'s a LOT of shit going on :)'),
(21, 2, 'Thanks again, for doing this interview ;)', 'Not a problem, thanks :)'),
(22, 1, '2. Did you always want to become an art director, designer?', 'I always wanted to create and be creative. I think a passion for gadgets                                   and computers brought me into digital design as I could do both things at                                   the same time.'),
(23, 1, '3. So be creative... be unique...  what does it mean for you? ', 'It all about not doing the obvious or what has gone before. Just because a                                   solution has been used by everyone, doesn\'t mean it\'s the best solution. I                                   believe though that a true skill is being creative within the commercial                                   environment and getting your client to share the passion for something new                                   - even risky.'),
(24, 1, '4. How do you position yourself as a designer? Describe your \'style\', like                                   a good friend of yours would describe it.', 'I am all about the detail. God (or the devil) is in the detail and it is                                   what can turn a great design solution into a great one. Everything from a                                   very subtle animation on a button, to how Apple design their products is                                   all about the number of small elements that are both creative                                   and re-thought for the end user. I\'m also known for being able to spot                                   something out of alignments by a pixel from across the room ;D'),
(25, 1, '5. Which of your works has given you the most satisfaction?', 'It is usually the project that has allowed a risky solution and produced                                   amazing results. Even when it is just an email design, but it jumps out as                                   a design that grabs your attention and makes you read it, click and                                   interact with a brand. The likes of McCain has this quality, and even                                   better when the products are in competition (inside your in box) with                                   messages that most would consider much more interesting!'),
(26, 1, '6. Sometimes it’s difficult to get started on a project, and brainstorm                                   design ideas. How do you get inspired and stay motivated?', 'I make sure I get creative input from as many sources as possible and from                                   a very wide selection of media. For example, web sites are an obvious place                                   to see great new work, but also looking at books and historic design. I\'m                                   loving retro at the moment :)'),
(27, 1, '7. What’s the best advice someone has given you?', 'Don\'t worry about it.'),
(28, 1, '8. Design theory and trends are constantly shifting and evolving. What do you think we’ll see more of in 2012?    ', 'A return to simplicity and making sure digital experiences work across all                                   methods of viewing them, e.g. Computer, iPad, Mobile phone, TV, etc.'),
(29, 1, '9. So what are you afraid of regarding the future?', 'I hope that \'digital\' continues to become mainstream and not return to                                   being a bolt-on. Gone are the days where offline design should dictate                                   online solutions, and we shouldn\'t go back to that way of thinking.'),
(30, 1, '10. When you are not designing or otherwise behind the computer, what do  you enjoy doing to step away for a while?', 'I have two daughters ages 1 and 3, and they take up a lot of my time - and                                   I enjoy every moment seeing how they grow - and yes, my eldest girl has an                                   iPod touch packed with movies and games. When I get time to my self I love                                   to take my Alfa Romeo for a drive on the twisty B-Roads (or even a track                                   now and then) or sat at home playing on my Xbox.');

I haven\'t heard from you for ages. Thanks so much for taking  the time to answer some questions for new Digitalica readers ;)\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					It\'s been a while, that\'s true. I\'m pretty well, thank you, just older, not much wiser though :) \r\n                                        Life\'s been treating me pretty good, I can\'t really complain - although there were some pretty rough times, all in all it turned out fine.\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					Good designers learn and improve over time. What are some of the important lessons you\'ve learned along the way?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					That I can do almost anything :) When you set your sights on a goal and you commit to that goal, there\'s nothing to stop you. I like to think about myself as a renaissance man because of the many, many things that interest me and the scope of knowledge I amassed over all those years - it might not be very thorough, mind you, but there just so little time in one day :) But when I got back to Warszawa for the second time in my life and started working at MRM Worldwide, I thought I wanted to only do my pixels, nothing else. Then I got challenged with other aspects of the agency work - client related, project management related, accounting even - I was sure to fail. But I didn\'t, I learned a lot and got a new perspective on my own work, started to move in a direction I never thought I wanted to go.\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					What\'s the best advice someone has given you?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					If you grumble, you don\'t fuck :) I\'ve spent quite some time with people, who gave me a new and much more simpler perspective on life that I used to have and i\'m trying to stick to that "philosophy of simplicity" - to not overthink things. And to let things flow and follow that flow - not to stand against the current. Like a straw, bend with the wind to not break, but to stand up again when the wind stops. Something along those lines, at least :)\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					Design theory and trends are constantly shifting and evolving. What do you think we\'ll see more of in 2010?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					I can\'t really say, since i\'m not really following trends too close. I\'ve been seeing more and more simple and "typograhic" portfolios and webpages - nice, big headers with nice, big, clean body texts. But it must be my bad eyesight and aging taking the better of me :) It took years for us to come from pixel fonts in sizes below readability, really, to arrive to headers at 40-60 points in custom typeface size. I\'ve always been an admirer of "less is more" doctrine and tried to follow that philosophy, now there are pretty neat tools to do that. I\'ve seen pretty awesome things that use iPhones in connection with desktop computers to achieve a very ambient effect - I\'d like to do more of that myself, to use many of the available tools and devices to connect them in one seamless project, to use Augmented Reality (although I HATE that term), there\'s still much to do on that field. \r\n                                        What I would really like to see is more "freedom from facebook" - lately I feel like people (meaning mostly clients) took Facebook for granted and turned it into "new internet" and everyone is "doing something on fb" - it\'s a great tool, but it\'s just a tool, not a solution to all your problems, for crying out loud. We\'ve been laughing at the idea that in one or two years from now we\'re gonna go back to standalone pages on custom domain names and everyone will think it\'ll be such a fucking avantgarde thing to do, "you\'re not doing it on facebook? that\'s radical...". Pretty sad perspective.\r\n				 \r\n\r\n                                \r\n					Handmade or digital? choose one , and why?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					Maybe I should say digital, but more and more I\'d like to touch the stuff I do. I read books on my phone out of convenience, but I really prefer the printed thing, the smell of the paint, touch of paper, especially the old one - the same with art, I love what people are doing with pixels, but I\'d like to hang that shit on my wall, you know? And I\'m not talking about printed out on a laser plotter or something - I want it done by hand, on a real canvas or wood, with real paint and brush, I want it dirty, not really finished, rough and not so close to the line. You can\'t undo, yes, but the feeling is real :) You can redo though, over and over again, aiming for that perfection. Too bad I really suck at that myself, since I can\'t do shit on my own - draw or paint - but they say there\'s always time to learn. And I learn to appreciate art in general, but especially in non-digital form, for example recently I fell in love with Audrey Kawasaki\'s work - it\'s absolutely gorgeous.\r\n				 \r\n\r\n                                \r\n					If you could collaborate with one other artist, designer? who would it be?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					I do collaborate with great artists on a daily basis, although the projects we work on are strictly commercial :) I\'ve always wanted to work with Joshua Davis, but more as a apprentice, a fly-on-the-wall rather then a fellow designer, I want to know his secret, his tricks :) \r\n                                        Currently I\'m working on an idea for a project that will support Infantile Spasms and Epilepsy Awareness foundation, I\'ve already took part in production of two books they\'re selling on blurb.com and raising money to spread the word and educate on this rare and difficult condition. And I\'ll try to invite some of the best people I\'ve met over the years to make it the most awesome shit there is - the cause is so right it has to work :)\r\n				 \r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n					What are some of your favorite design blogs that you read?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n					I don\'t really :) I stopped following design blogs years ago and pretty much thought link sites died off - I was wrong, obviously :) And thank to gods for that. When I was doing some packaging stuff I\'ve been reading thedieline.com and yankodesign.com all the time. Nowadays, I visit Behance on a daily basis - just to piss myself off, I guess, at the quality of work OTHER people do. The old classics, like surfstation, designiskinky... I don\'t, really - mostly because I just don\'t have the time.\r\n				 \r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n                                    So, what\'s next...?\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n                                    More work :) There are ideas coming in, there\'s lot to do still, another day, another challenge... There\'s this project for Infantile Spasm foundation, I\'ve been talking with Jedrek Kostecki about some things we want to do together, I have a couple of photo projects on my mind, an idea for a desktop/iphone application... And since restless and unstoppable Wojtek Krosnowski is my CD, there\'s no telling when we\'re gonna stop - there\'s a LOT of shit going on :)\r\n				 \r\n\r\n                                \r\n                                    Thanks again, for doing this interview ;)\r\n				 \r\n\r\n				\r\n                                    Not a problem, thanks :)\r\n				 \r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                 Interviewed by aneta(at)anetadesign.com  \r\n                                \r\n                                 &laquo; Back to Interviews  \r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n			 \r\n			\n\n				\n					\n				 \n\n				\n                                    \n					\n                                        \n					\n					  \n                                     \n				 \n\n				\n                                                                                    \n                                                    \n                                             \n                                                                                            \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                                18.12.2011      Deski Dance  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                                                                                     \n                                                             \n                                                                                                         \n                                                \n                                                     One of the biggest snow &amp; music festival from Poland!

Did you always want to become an art director, designer? \r\n\r\n                                 I always wanted to create and be creative. I think a passion for gadgets\r\n                                 and computers brought me into digital design as I could do both things at\r\n                                 the same time.\r\n                                       \r\n\r\n                                  3. So be creative... be unique...  what does it mean for you?    \r\n\r\n                                 It all about not doing the obvious or what has gone before. Just because a\r\n                                 solution has been used by everyone, doesn\'t mean it\'s the best solution. I\r\n                                 believe though that a true skill is being creative within the commercial\r\n                                 environment and getting your client to share the passion for something new\r\n                                 - even risky.\r\n                                    \r\n\r\n                                  4. How do you position yourself as a designer? Describe your \'style\', like\r\n                                 a good friend of yours would describe it.        \r\n\r\n                                 I am all about the detail. God (or the devil) is in the detail and it is\r\n                                 what can turn a great design solution into a great one. Everything from a\r\n                                 very subtle animation on a button, to how Apple design their products is\r\n                                 all about the number of small elements that are both creative\r\n                                 and re-thought for the end user. I\'m also known for being able to spot\r\n                                 something out of alignments by a pixel from across the room ;D\r\n                                 \r\n\r\n                                  5. Which of your works has given you the most satisfaction?         \r\n\r\n                                 It is usually the project that has allowed a risky solution and produced\r\n                                 amazing results. Even when it is just an email design, but it jumps out as\r\n                                 a design that grabs your attention and makes you read it, click and\r\n                                 interact with a brand. The likes of McCain has this quality, and even\r\n                                 better when the products are in competition (inside your in box) with\r\n                                 messages that most would consider much more interesting!\r\n                                       \r\n\r\n                                 6. Sometimes itâ€™s difficult to get started on a project, and brainstorm\r\n                                 design ideas. How do you get inspired and stay motivated?    \r\n\r\n                                 I make sure I get creative input from as many sources as possible and from\r\n                                 a very wide selection of media. For example, web sites are an obvious place\r\n                                 to see great new work, but also looking at books and historic design. I\'m\r\n                                 loving retro at the moment :)\r\n                                    \r\n\r\n                                  7. Whatâ€™s the best advice someone has given you?     \r\n\r\n                                 Don\'t worry about it.\r\n                                 \r\n\r\n                                 8. Design theory and trends are constantly shifting and evolving. What do\r\n                                 you think weâ€™ll see more of in 2010?       \r\n\r\n                                 A return to simplicity and making sure digital experiences work across all\r\n                                 methods of viewing them, e.g. Computer, iPad, Mobile phone, TV, etc.\r\n                                       \r\n\r\n                                 9. So what are you afraid of regarding the future? \r\n\r\n                                 I hope that \'digital\' continues to become mainstream and not return to\r\n                                 being a bolt-on. Gone are the days where offline design should dictate\r\n                                 online solutions, and we shouldn\'t go back to that way of thinking.\r\n                                        \r\n\r\n                                 10.
